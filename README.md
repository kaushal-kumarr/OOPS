# 🚀 C++ OOP Practice Projects

This repository contains my personal **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** practice programs written in **C++**. As a learner, 
I wrote these programs while learning and understanding the core concepts of OOP using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.

## 📘 What This Repo Covers

These programs are based on real-world examples and demonstrate key OOP principles:

- ✅ Classes and Objects
- ✅ Constructors  // To initialize the values 
- ✅ Inheritance (Single, Multilevel, Multiple,Hierarchical)
- ✅ Encapsulation  // wrapping up of data in single unit 
- ✅ Polymorphism    // same function different working
- ✅ Access Specifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`)

## 🛠 Tools Used

- 💻 **Language**: C++
- 🖥️ **IDE**: Visual Studio Code
- 🧰 **Compiler**: g++ (MinGW or GCC)

The main goal is learning by doing. I'm using simple, relatable examples to understand how OOP works in real-world programming.
